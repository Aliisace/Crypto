It's getting late, and I
Can't seem to find my way home tonight
Feels like I am falling down a rabbit hole
Falling for forever
Wonderfully wondering alone

What would my head be like
If not for my shoulders
Or without your smile?
May it follow you forever
May it never leave you
To sleep in the stone
May we, stay lost on our way home

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

If I should die tonight
May I first just say I'm sorry
For I, never felt like anybody
I am a man of many hats although I
Never mastered anything
When I am ten feet tall
I never felt much smaller since the fall
Nobody seems to know my name
So don't leave me to sleep all alone
May we stay lost on our way home
 
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities

Try not to mistake what you have with what you hate
It could leave, it could leave, come the morning
Celebrate the night
It's the fall before the climb
Shall we sing, shall we sing, until the morning?

If I fall forward, you fall flat
And if the sun should lift me up
Would you come back?
C'mon

C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
C'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
So c'mon, c'mon, with everything falling down around me
I'd like to believe in all the possibilities
Yeah yeah yeah!

It's getting late, and I cannot seem to find my way home tonight
