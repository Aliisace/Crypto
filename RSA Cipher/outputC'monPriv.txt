Its getting late and ICant seem to find my way home tonightFeels like I am falling down a rabbit holeFalling for foreverWonderfully wondering aloneWhat would my head be likeIf not for my shouldersOr without your smile?May it follow you foreverMay it never leave youTo sleep in the stoneMay we stay lost on our way homeCmon cmon with everything falling down around meId like to believe in all the possibilitiesIf I should die tonightMay I first just say Im sorryFor I never felt like anybodyI am a man of many hats although INever mastered anythingWhen I am ten feet tallI never felt much smaller since the fallNobody seems to know my nameSo dont leave me to sleep all aloneMay we stay lost on our way home Cmon cmon with everything falling down around meId like to believe in all the possibilitiesCmon cmon with everything falling down around meId like to believe in all the possibilitiesTry not to mistake what you have with what you hateIt could leave it could leave come the morningCelebrate the nightIts the fall before the climbShall we sing shall we sing until the morning?If I fall forward you fall flatAnd if the sun should lift me upWould you come back?CmonCmon cmon with everything falling down around meId like to believe in all the possibilitiesCmon cmon with everything falling down around meId like to believe in all the possibilitiesSo cmon cmon with everything falling down around meId like to believe in all the possibilitiesYeah yeah yeah!Its getting late and I cannot seem to find my way home tonightAA
